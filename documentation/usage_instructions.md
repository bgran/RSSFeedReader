Usage instructions for RSS reader
=================================

The application consists of two list panes, the upper is for subscribed feeds, the lower is for the content of the particular feed.

The upper text field is for subscribing to feeds. You enter a feed URL in the text field, and click the "Get RSS" button on the right. The new entry should appear in the upper feed pane.

By double clicking a feed, you get the contents of the feed in the lower pane. Further selecting by double clicking a feed headline you get a new web browser window opened with the detailed data of the feed.

Through the "A Menu" menu bar, you can select to remove a highlighted feed, or remove all feeds present in the upper pane.
